# Forward Alert Msg to Telegram

This code allows you to integrate forward alert messages with Telegram. It is designed to send real-time Forex alerts to traders using the Telegram messaging platform.

## Developer's Site
[Forex Robot Easy](https://forexroboteasy.com) is the developer of this code.

## How it Works
1. The code initializes the Telegram connection by creating a `CTelegram` object.
2. The `InitializeTelegram()` function is called to initialize the Telegram connection. It checks if the initialization is successful and sets the chat ID for sending messages.
3. The `SendForexAlert()` function is used to send Forex alert messages to the trader's Telegram account. It checks if the Telegram connection is initialized and then sends the alert message using the `SendMessage()` method of the `CTelegram` object.
4. The `CheckMarketTrends()` function checks the market trends and generates alert messages. In this sample code, it sets the trend message to 'Market trends: Bullish'. You can modify this function to check the actual market trends.
5. The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `InitializeTelegram()` function to initialize the Telegram connection, checks the market trends using the `CheckMarketTrends()` function, and finally terminates the Telegram connection using the `Terminate()` method of the `CTelegram` object.

## Usage
To use this code, you need to have a Telegram account and a valid chat ID. Replace `'YOUR_CHAT_ID'` in the code with your actual chat ID. You can obtain your chat ID by creating a Telegram bot and following the instructions provided by the official Telegram API documentation.
